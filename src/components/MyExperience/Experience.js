It is the school where I started learning and experienced programming in Web Development.<br><br>King’s College of the Philippines is a mission school under the auspices of the Northern Luzon Presbyterian Church. Its beginnings can be traced to the arrival of a Korean Missionary, Rev. Kwon Young-Soo in the Philippines in 1991.<br><br>For more than a decade, Missionary Kwon laboriously ministered to a great number of people in the various Cordillera provinces namely: Mt. Province, Kalinga, Apayao, Ifugao, Benguet, Isabela, Cagayan, and also Baguio City. Noting the lack of trained clergy, Rev. Kwon established a Bible School named Zoe Logos Temple Ministry in Sabangan, Mt. Province. Eventually, to address the concern of the growing number of unschooled youth in the Cordilleras, and with assistance from a church and individual sponsors – local and overseas, he established Eastern Luzon Colleges in Bambang, Nueva Vizcaya in 2003 and Eastern Luzon Colleges in 2004 in La Trinidad, Benguet.`,
